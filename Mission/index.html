      <h1>About</h1>
      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>The increasing urban population around the globe requires more intelligent, integrated designs to make its cities more resilient to emergencies along transportation infrastructure.
          Our goal is to develop an automated system to alert emergency medical services (EMS) the moment a car crash has occurred. The idea was inspired by the growing issue of car crashes in Atlanta as well as the fatalities and traffic caused by that. Every year more and more people move to the city, making the roadways more congested and making the interstate system near impossible to navigate during rush hours. Car crashes are a main contributor to that and by reducing the time of response even by a couple of minutes lives, time and money can be saved.</p>
      <h3>Solution</h3>
      <p>Our automated system involves a network of physical vibration sensors that remotely detect the crash through machine-learned pattern recognition of the physical vibrations emitted in the event. The current solution is the 911 call: waiting for an onlooker to call and describe the location, situation, and severity of the crash. The response after the 911 call is almost as efficient as possible, and has been optimized thoroughly. A call can take even more than five minutes, between the moment of the crash to the end of the call. Additionally, if there are no onlookers the crash can go unreported. According to EMS even 1 minute can help save someone's life, as first-aid will be able to arrive faster. Moreover, a minute of traffic on the I-75/I-85 connector in Atlanta costs the surrounding economy $1 million, and the impact per minute increases with each minute. </p>
      <h3>Market</h3>
      <p>We are currently working with the Georgia Department of Transportation to begin putting units on the road, test their ability, and continue improvements. When we can deliver a technology, the GDOT along other companies working in the Smart Cities field are interested in investing in this infrastructure. We as well are applying to the SmartCity initiative which currently has given money to Columbus, Ohio, and will hopefully be able to develop our technology in this government subsidized environment. With a success in either city, we can then begin moving into other cities or municipalities to build our tech. We engage people by showing how many lives we save and how much more efficient their EMS can be by using our platform. Given the technical background of the group as well as the policy background, we will have the ability to work out issues such as budgeting and applications for grants to make the process as seamless as possible.</p>
