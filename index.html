      <h1>About</h1>
      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p>Centree focuses on Smart Cities, IoT [Internet of Things] and reporting emergencies. Our goal is to help cities and IoT companies understand their auditory data, and enable them to automatically detect and respond to emergencies, such as car crashes and car break-ins. Our current focus is on car crashes. Our product SmartBloc is an automated system that alerts Emergency Medical Services [EMS] the moment a car crash has occurred. Using auditory sensors and machine learning we have created boxes that are placed on streets and intersections that listen for car crashes, detect them and report them to the authorities. Reporting a car crash seconds after it happens can significantly reduce the time of response which according to testimonies from Emergency Responders and data from the Atlanta Police Department is enough to have an impact. Even 1 min can save a life and each minute of car-crash caused traffic costs the local economy around $1 million. SmartBloc saves lives, time and money and is an essential part of smart cities.</p>
      <h3>Market</h3>
      <p>We are currently working with the Georgia Department of Transportation to test our product by installing units on the locations with the highest rate of crashes in Atlanta, test it and continue improvements. Working with DOTs and smart city initiatives around the US is our primary goal, as they allow us to install our product on poles they own, provide us with funding in most cases and connect us to the EMS and police network that we need. We are also starting the process of working with a towing company in Toronto to install our boxes on intersections around the city that will help them respond to incidents faster, remove the vehicles faster and as a result reduce the traffic caused by these incidents. We are also beginning the process of working with the city of San Francisco to tackle the problem of car break-ins that is becoming worse and worse day by day. We will place our boxes on streets and notify police officers of possible car break-ins so they can respond faster and prevent suspects from leaving the scene. Finally, we have established close relationships with other Smart Cities Startups and researchers in San Francisco and New York and looking into possible co-deployments of our products.</p>
      <h3>Why Centree</h3>
      <p>One of the main things we are basing our business off of is selling a platform to cities. There are various startups and companies that go to cities and try to sell them a device that can make their city smarter. Even though their technology might be great, cities can't purchase 10 different devices and install all of these at each intersection all over the city. What we are doing is find a couple of other startups, get them to license their algorithm to us and then we load all the algorithms on our box and sell it to cities as a subscription. Another important part of our business is that we are using auditory data and not visual data. Companies tend to start with visual data and don't really consider audio. Audio takes way less time to process and can give you info that computer vision can't give you, which makes our business more appealing, easy to install and cheap.</p>
      <p>Cities need to ensure that their citizens get the fastest possible response in the case of an unfortunate accident or other type of emergency. The authorities want to be there at the scene right when these unfortunate events occur, but they can't be everywhere at all times and relying to witnesses to notify them fast enough doesn't work out in a lot of cases. Our product can make EMS' work easier and more efficient, as getting to the scene even 1min earlier can help keep injuries to minimum damage and even save lives. Police work will become easier as well, as it can get them at the scene faster and then any potential suspects won't be able to escape.</p>

      <h3>SmartBloc</h3>
      <p>We have developed a box of auditory sensors that can be placed in streets and can detect crashes or car break-ins. Within the metal box, that we place 12ft high, we have a microphone and other equipment needed for sending the sounds to our AWS, put it through our machine learning model and accordingly alert the authorities or not. We built and are still improving our machine learning model by collecting car crash sounds and glass breaking sounds from car crash testing facilities, specific locations in the city of Atlanta, and online resources.
